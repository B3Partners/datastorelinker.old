##   - Error messages for:
##       - Standard validation error messages
##       - Converter error messages

#Long descriptions:
ActionCombo_Fix_From_Oracle.longdesc = All columns of the Short type are converted to the Integer type.
ActionCombo_Fix_To_Oracle.longdesc = The table name will be changed so that it \
can be used as an Oracle table name. This means that the table name \
is converted to uppercase and the length is adjusted to the \
maximum length of 14. When exceeding the maximum length, \
uses the last part of the table name. All attribute names will also be \
converted to capital letters.
ActionCombo_Recommended.longdesc = Creates safe values \u200b\u200bfor your DataStoreLinker process: \
All values \u200b\u200bin a String string are given a maximum value of 255 to prevent the PostGIS 256 bug. \
The table name is given a safe value. \
The projection is put on EPSG: 28992 (Amersfoort, New) to prevent the Shape bug.
ActionCombo_Recommended_Pro.longdesc = Creates safe values \u200b\u200bfor your DataStoreLinker process: \
All values \u200b\u200bin a String string are given a maximum value of 255 to prevent the PostGIS 256 bug. \
The table name is given a new safe value that you can determine yourself. \
The projection is put on EPSG: 28992 (Amersfoort, New) to prevent the Shape bug.

#not used:
ActionCombo_GeometrySingle_Writer.longdesc = Adjust the geometry in the SimpleFeatureType to the geometry in the SimpleFeature. Pay attention; therefore only one geometry type may be loaded
ActionCombo_GeometrySplitter_Writer.longdesc = The different geometries are at output \
stored in separate tables with a suffix. (_p, _l, _v and _mv)

#not used:
ActionDataStore_Writer.longdesc = Write the SimpleFeature to a datastore. If the datastore is a database, the SimpleFeature can be added or the table can be emptied before adding

ActionFeatureType_AttributeType_Remove.longdesc = Delete a column from the table.
ActionFeatureType_AttributeType_Restriction.longdesc = Limit values \u200b\u200bin a column to a specified length.
ActionFeatureType_Replace_Class.longdesc = Change the type of column indicated
ActionFeatureType_Replace_Class_All.longdesc = Change the type of all columns with type X to type Y. For example, all Integers to Doubles.
ActionFeatureType_Set_CRS.longdesc = Set another projection (default is "EPSG: 28992")
ActionFeatureType_Typename_AppendAttribute.longdesc = Create a new new table per separate value of the specified column name. \
The value is truncated at the specified length and pasted to the input table name. \
If a column contains a total of five different values \u200b\u200bfrom the input table, 5 different output tables are created with the name "<input table name> <truncated value>".
ActionFeatureType_Typename_Case.longdesc = Converts a table name to only capital letters or just lowercase letters.
ActionFeatureType_Typename_Substring.longdesc = Shorten the table name by means of a substring. A final index of -1 indicates that the end of the value must be continued.
ActionFeatureType_Typename_Update.longdesc = Change a table name. The name can be replaced or renewed.
ActionFeatureType_Parse_Date.longdesc = Change the date to a formatted string.

ActionFeatureType_AttributeNames_Rename.longdesc = Select a separate output column name for each input column. During execution of the process, input columns where you have not entered an output column name are removed. The geometry column is not removed.
ActionFeatureType_AttributeNames_Map_To_Output.longdesc = Choose an entry column for each output column. During executing the process, output columns that you have not selected an entry are left empty.

ActionFeature_Value_ReplaceText.longdesc = Replace text in the value of a particular column.
ActionFeature_Value_Replace.longdesc = Replace text in the value of all columns.
ActionFeature_Value_Set.longdesc = Replace or expand value of a particular column.

ActionGeometry_Make_Point.longdesc = Convert the values \u200b\u200bfrom two selected columns to a point. For example from COORD_X and COORD_Y.
ActionGeometry_RemoveDuplicateVertices.longdesc = Delete double consecutive vertices. This may prevent software that does not expect this to crash (such as ArcGIS 9.3.1).
ActionGeometry_VertexPrecisionThreshold.longdesc = Ignore feature if the coordinates of all vertices on a given scale are identical. This may prevent software that can not handle such features from accepting a dataset (such as ArcGIS 9.3.1).
